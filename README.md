# han-asd-adp-project

This project is an exam excercise for the HAN ASD course that part of the HBO-ICT degree. The project contains Abstract Data Type (ADT) & Algoritm implementations.

## Structure

The whole solution is written in C#, and contains 4 projects in total:

* ADPProject.Library: This projects contains the ADT/algoritm implementations.
* ADPProject.UnitTests: This projects tests wheter the ADT's/algoritms actually function as they should.
* ADPProject.PerformanceTests: This projects tests the peformance of all ADT methods and algoritm by executing the opertation x amount of time and measuring the time taken.
* ADPProject.DataTests: This projects tests wheter the ADT/Algoritm implementation actually can read the datasets provided by the HAN.

## Running the code

To run the code without having to setup a local dev environment you could use the GitHub codespace feature (VS Code web using a cloud hosted dev container) or use VS Code's dev container feature locally. To create a dev container that contains all the required VS Code extensions you can use the `devcontainer.json` file that's available in the `.devcontainer` folder within this repository.
