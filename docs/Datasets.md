# Minimal Test Dataset

To ensure that your implementations are somewhat interchangeable and therefore comparable, there is also a minimum test dataset. At least the following dataset in JSON format, with per algorithm or data structure relevant data:

* `dataset_sorteren.json`
  * Dynamic Array
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Stack
  * Deque
  * Priority Queue
  * Binary Search
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Parallel Merge Sort
  * AVL-SearchTree
* `dataset_hashing.json`
  * Hash Table
* `dataset_grafen.json`
  * Graph
  * Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
